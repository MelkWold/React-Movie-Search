GLAB 320H.7.1 - React Movie Search

Learning Objectives
After this lab, learners will have demonstrated the ability to:

Use create-react-app to make a pre-configured React application.
Use the useEffect React hook.
Implement the lifting state pattern in React.
Bind React components to user input elements.
Make external API requests within a React application.

Instructions
If you have not yet installed Node.js and npm, please take the time to do so. If you have trouble installing Node, speak with your instructors.

Within this lab activity, we will make use of the useEffect hook, practice lifting state that is shared by components, and briefly explore making AJAX/Fetch API requests within a React application. We'll talk more about third-party APIs data fetching in a future lesson.

We will do this by creating a simple application with an input form that allows us to search for a movie, and components that display the results of that search.
